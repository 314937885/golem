# Casey - Test Case Management Tool

Casey is test case design, organizing, executing and reporting tool. Casey lets you easily design test cases without getting in the way, create test cases by modules, requirements, pages etc. and then arrange them in suites and finally execute them. It adapts easily to the project.

## How It Works
Casey allows you to write and execute test cases in excel like datasheet format, but under cover keeps track of each individual test case with an unique id. It also comes with a detailed view to help focus on the test cases one by one.

Casey lets you import and export test case worksheets to and from excel files.

## Test Execution

Casey keeps the source test cases (test case lists and suites) separated from the execution tests. Each time an execution starts, a copy of the test case list is created and the execution takes place on the copied tests, so it is easy to keep track with precision of the exact tests that were executed and allows, at the same time, to keep adding changes to the source tests as the application evolves, thus keeping the test suites alive.
